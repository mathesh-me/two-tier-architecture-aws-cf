## Create a YAML template for deploying our Architecture

In this step, we are going to create a YAML template for deploying our two-tier architecture. The YAML template will consist of the following resources:

1. You can Download the YAML template from the repository.
2. You can also create Template by yourself using the AWS Official Documentation: [Documentation Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)
3. Refer appropriate Resources Correctly to get Correct Syntax.
